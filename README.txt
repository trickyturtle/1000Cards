Deviations:
	• We chose to use a Tab Bar instead of a Navigation sidebar. We felt this was a better design solution as it eliminated a “home page” screen containing buttons in place of the tabs we have put in our Tab Bar. It also allowed for better navigation as you would not have to go back to the home page every time you wanted to interact with a different feature, and it yields fewer clicks to navigate a Tab Bar instead of a navigation sidebar.

Comments:
	• For card creation, functionality is not implemented yet but the design has been completed. Functionality of card creation will be implemented in Beta release. In the Card View screen, the Title is the name of the card, the Image View is the actual card, and the Description is the description of the card.
